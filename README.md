# OMICRON - 802.11 transceivers with adaptive MCS
The aim of this experiments is to use the flexibility of Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology and GNU Radio for implementing different real 802.11 Wi-Fi transceivers capable of maximise the spectral efficiency by implementing adaptive modulation schemes. The main idea is to adapt the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to the different variations present in wireless channels.

More information about the projet objective and the usage and installation of the different developed transceivers is available in [the wiki page](https://github.com/reysam93/OMICRON-GNURadio/wiki) of this repository.

This repository contains the modules and examples inside the OMICRON project, realized by the TSC of the URJC.
